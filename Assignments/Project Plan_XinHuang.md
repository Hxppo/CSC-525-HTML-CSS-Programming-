##Description
This zip contains all the html, css and media files of this final project. The requirements of the signature assignment includes:  
1. Flex Box Model
2. @media query
3. two-column description (CSS3)  
4. at least one box with rounded corners (CSS3) with a background color or image  
5. pseudoclasses and pseudoelements  
6. embedded video

8. an image  
9. at least one HTML5 structural element  
10. at least a link  
11. a form for the user to submit asking for more info about the product  

To do that, I built a simple website featuring Pokemon Wiki. All the features mentioned above are used. I also used embedded twitter content to enrich the content of the page. Several public web page are linked to my page as well.
