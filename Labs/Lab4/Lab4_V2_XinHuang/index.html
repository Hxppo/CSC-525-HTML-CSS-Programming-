            <p>Mind and body united equals happy life.</p>
            <p>It took me a long time to realize how tense I became when I was not doing something I truly believed in
                or when I was put in a situation when I had to pretend.</p>
            <p>Believe me, without realizing it, we spend most of our time pretending. This is why most of us are
                stressed.</p>
            <p>So I made a decision to make sure my mind and body were in scrunicity. So as I go through my daily
                business, I am especially sensitive to any tension in my body.</p>
            <p>And any time I feel any tension, I remind myself to relax, loosen up and empty my mind. Almost do a mini
                meditation. Then I come back to whatever I am doing and do it in a way that feels acceptable to me.</p>

            <h2>Who Am I</h2>
            <p>The “Who Am I?” question has far-reaching changes than you realize when you first ask it. It also
                requires some effort to uncover the answer. Once you find out who you are, a powerful force emerges. You
                want to dig deeper. You want to find out more. You start asking other questions such as:</p>
