  <p>The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America (/?'m?r?k?/), is a federal republic[14][15] composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.[fn 6] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)[17] and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area[fn 7] and the third-most populous. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.

  <p>The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[31] The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas[32][33] and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[34] Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[35] Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[36] The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,[37] human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.[38] The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending.[39] It is also a global leader in science and technology.
